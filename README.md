# Restaurants-Visualization

Existing System
In order to find restaurants known for their popular food items, users have to visit the restaurants webpages manually. It is very time consuming and user inconvenient. 

Need of the Project	
Currently there is no such existing platform which can provide information of restaurants popular for their food items. So there is a need of a user convenient platform where user can search for their favourite food items and get the list of restaurants where they could visit instantly without involving much efforts.
